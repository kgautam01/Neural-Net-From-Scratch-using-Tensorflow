# Neural-Net-From-Scratch-using-Tensorflow
A Neural net implementation using tensorflow and written from scratch, containing forward prop, backward prop and cost
computation. It can be used for any desired number of hidden layers, to be passed as parameters. It used AdamOptimizer,
L2 regularization and results in a good accuracy of about 96% on test set of MNIST dataset.
